ROS nodes can pass messages to one another through topics, make service calls to other nodes, provide a service for other nodes, or set or retrieve shared data from a communal database called the parameter server. A process called the ROS1 Master[66] makes all of this possible by registering nodes to themselves, setting up node-to-node communication for topics, and controlling parameter server updates. Messages and service calls do not pass through the master, rather the master sets up peer-to-peer communication between all node processes after they register themselves with the master. This decentralized architecture lends itself well to robots, which often consist of a subset of networked computer hardware, and may communicate with off-board computers for heavy computing or commands.\r\nNodes"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"A node represents one process running the ROS graph. Every node has a name, which registers with the ROS1 master before it can take any other actions. Multiple nodes with different names can exist under different namespaces, or a node can be defined as anonymous, in which case it will randomly generate an additional identifier to add to its given name.

The types of messages passed on a topic vary widely and can be user-defined.

A service represents an action that a node can take which will have a single result.

Nodes advertise services and call services from one another.\r\nParameter server\r\nThe parameter server is a database shared between nodes which allows for communal access to static or semi-static information.
