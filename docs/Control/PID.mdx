# PID Control

A **PID controller** is a feedback control method used to make a system follow a desired value or trajectory. The name comes from its three components:

- **P** — Proportional  
- **I** — Integral  
- **D** — Derivative  

Each term is related to the error of the system.

---

## What Is "Error"?

A PID controller continuously computes an error:

![e(t) = r(t) - y(t)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\color{white}e(t)=r(t)-y(t))

where:

- \(r(t)\) = setpoint (desired value)
- \(y(t)\) = measurement (current value)

The controller then uses this error to generate a control signal.

---

## The Three Terms

### 1. Proportional Term (P)

The proportional term is defined by the **current error**:

![P_p(t) = K_p e(t)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\color{white}P_p(t)=K_p%20e(t))

- and a gain \(K_p\).  
- Large \(K_p\) → fast response, but too large can cause oscillations.

The intuition is to apply more control when the error is large and less when the state is close to the target.

---

### 2. Integral Term (I)

The integral term reacts to **accumulated error**:

![P_i(t) = K_i ∫₀ᵗ e(τ) dτ](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\color{white}P_i(t)=K_i\int_0^t%20e(\tau)\,d\tau)

- Helps eliminate **steady-state error**.  
- Too much integral gain can cause slow oscillations or drift.

The controller effectively gains “memory” of past errors.

---

### 3. Derivative Term (D)

The derivative term reacts to the **rate of change of error**:

![P_d(t) = K_d de(t)/dt](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\color{white}P_d(t)=K_d\frac{de(t)}{dt})

- Acts as damping to reduce overshoot.  
- Helps predict error trends.

**Intuition:** Slow down when approaching the target too fast.

## Full PID Formula

Combining all three terms:

![u(t) = K_p e(t) + K_i ∫₀ᵗ e(τ)dτ + K_d de(t)/dt](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\color{white}u(t)=K_p%20e(t)%20+%20K_i\int_0^t%20e(\tau)\,d\tau%20+%20K_d\frac{de(t)}{dt})

This control signal \(u(t)\) is applied to the system continuously.

---

## Tuning PID

Common strategies:

1. Start with **P only**; increase until oscillation starts, then reduce.
2. Add **D** to damp oscillations.
3. Add **I** last to remove steady-state error.

Automated tuning methods also exist (e.g., Ziegler–Nichols).

## Why PID?

They are popular because they are:

- Simple  
- Stable  
- Easy to tune  
- Widely understood

## Closing Remarks, other Resources

With this control law, given good choices for our weights (K_p, K_i, K_d), we can control a system to our setpoint using this intuitive formulation.
