# Path Planning Research 

This is where we will compile new possible methods and algorithms for the path planning team. Feel free to add sources here. When you do please leave a short description of the method and how we can use it for WUAIR.

* **Overview:** This foundational paper from the TU Munich team presents a robust method for calculating the "racing line" (minimum curvature trajectory) using Quadratic Programming (QP). It explains how to generate these paths based on simple occupancy grids and introduces a control strategy to drive the car at its physical handling limits . It is a key resource for understanding how to mathematically optimize a vehicle's path for speed rather than just safety.
